/*
 * We follow the Spring Data JPA repository pattern to create a repository interface for the Movie entity.
 * The name should be in the format of <EntityName>Repository.
 * We extend the CrudRepository interface provided by Spring Data JPA because it provides CRUD operations for the entity and we pass the entity type and the type of its primary key to the interface.
 *  We need to use the annotation @Repository to indicate that this interface is a repository.
 *  We can also define custom query methods in this interface to perform specific queries on the Movie entity.
